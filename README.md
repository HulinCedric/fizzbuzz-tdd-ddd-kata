# fizzbuzz-tdd-ddd-kata
A tdd kata on the famous **FizzBuzz** exercice with solution inspired by the domain driven design.

## Description
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print **Fizz** instead of the number and for the multiples of five print **Buzz**. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print **FizzBuzz**.

## Rules
1. Follow the TDD principles to design a simple FizzBuzz implementation.
2. Refactor the code to integrate DDD principles.
